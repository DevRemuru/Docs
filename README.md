## The future of self market making

Ultra-low latency, fully reliability, no-coding. All easy-to-use.

ForgeX is an infrastructure-based on-chain self market making and trading
terminal for all crypto projects and teams.

At ForgeX, our vision is to catalyze the emergence of efficient on-chain
markets by empowering every project team to own and operate their own
liquidity. We believe that, in crypto, supply creates its own demand — when
liquidity is active, transparent, and responsive, markets naturally attract
participation.
